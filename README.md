## How Logistic Regression Comes (Two terms in Logistic Regression)
Logistic regression is the combination of linear regression and logit (Regression: linear regression and Logistic: logits)

Initially was 
Z = b0+b1*x1

Here we are getting the values beyond the range of (0 to 1) (-infinity to +infinity) but we need values between (0 to 1)
So,
in place of probability p, we are using the ODDS p/(1-p), the values will range between (0 to +infinity)
Next, we apply ln(log base e) to get the linear relation between the independent variable and dependent variable ln(p/(1-p)) = b0+b1*x1, we get the values in between (-infinity to +infinity)
Next, we apply 'e' to the both side equations e^(ln(p/(1-p))) = e^(b0+b1*x1) (since e^x is x)
p/(1-p) = e^(b0+b1*x1) (let's say b0+b1*x1 is z)
p/(1-p) = e^z
p = (1-p)e^z
p = e^z-p*e^z
p + p*e^z = e^z
p(1+e^z) = e^z
p = e^z/(1+e^z)
p = 1/(1+e^-z)

this is how we get the final logistic regression equation

























## ðŸ“˜ Understanding Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that combines two key ideas:

- **Regression**: Uses a linear combination of features (like linear regression)
- **Logistic (Logit)**: Applies a transformation to map the output to a probability between 0 and 1

---

### ðŸ”¢ Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Start with a Linear Equation**  
   We begin with a linear combination of input features:  
   \[
   z = b_0 + b_1x_1
   \]  
   However, this output can range from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\), which isn't valid for probabilities.

2. **Convert to Odds**  
   We express the probability \(p\) in terms of odds:  
   \[
   \text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1 - p}
   \]  
   Odds range from \(0\) to \(+\infty\).

3. **Apply the Logit Function**  
   Take the natural logarithm (log base e) of the odds to linearize the relationship:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = b_0 + b_1x_1
   \]

4. **Solve for p (Probability)**  
   Let \( z = b_0 + b_1x_1 \), then:  
   \[
   \frac{p}{1 - p} = e^z
   \]  
   Solving for \( p \):

   \[
   p = \frac{e^z}{1 + e^z}
   \]

   This can also be written as:

   \[
   p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
   \]

---

### âœ… Final Logistic Regression Formula:

\[
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1)}}
\]

This is the **sigmoid function**, which maps any real-valued number into the (0, 1) interval â€” making it ideal for predicting probabilities in binary classification.

ðŸ§  Logistic regression is powerful because it keeps the interpretability of linear models while working for classification tasks by squashing outputs between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function.
